# boggle-solver

Prior to Dev Bootcamp, I took the Coursera Algorithms course and one of the challenges was to take an existing boggle board and create a solver class that finds all possible solutions from a given dictionary.

During Devbootcamp, one of my challenges was to build a boggle board and a method that can detect if a given phrase is in the board.

This is basically my attempt to combine the two by writing the solver in ruby instead of java and by touching my original boggle board as little as possible. I primarily worked on this on my train rides to/from DBC.
